A simple python-Flask app that gets my son to revise algebra.

A cron job turns internet access off on his Windows gaming machine every morning using SaltStack.

The app asks 3 questions - simple linear simultaneous equations.

Once the 3 questions have been answered, the app uses salt to turn Internet access back on on his gaming computer.
